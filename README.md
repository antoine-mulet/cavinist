Wine cellar management API.

## What is this project?
The sole purpose of this project was to build a simple API mixing technologies I already knew and liked and other 
technologies I wanted to play with. The API capabilities are very limited, but I believe they cover a fairly wide range 
of "real life" use cases, hence why I made this repository public, in case it may help and/or inspire other people. 

Why wine? just because I like wine :)
